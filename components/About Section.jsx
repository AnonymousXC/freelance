                    I started as a game development in school, and later I founded DevStudio alone. As a founder, I learned a lot about managing a company, team, and projects. I also learned App Development and Full Stack Web Development.

                    And in less than a year, I found my passion for coding. Now, I‚Äôm selling digital goods on the web and working on freelance projects. I love helping small businesses to create their online presence and help setting up their own online store (e-commerce) to boost their business.

                    My code ensures that it is developer-friendly as it passes through the lens of my experience as a app developer. When I code, I make sure it is 100% readable and understood by other developers. I document the whole code with comments for better understanding.
